# Part2: Debt-to-GDP ratio (2)
In this case, I choose to use the population pyramid as the third chart to present the data. After upload the data into Flourish, I changed the name of column G to "Debt-to-GDP ratio" and then select columns to visualize. I choose the column F (TIME) as label, column G (Debt-to-GDP ratio) as value, and column A (LOCATION) as row filter. After that, I go to preview and customize my template. I choose Area chart (stacked) as my chart type and green in Accent as the color of the chart because I believe green is a light color which could make the change of the data points in chart conspicuous. I also add a title and a subtitle to the chart and adjust their size and weight. A source is also added in the footer.

# Part2: Written summary
Data visualization is a useful and common tool in data analysis. There are various tyoes of charts available, each with its own strengths and use cases. 

For example, bar charts show value through the height of bars from the baseline. It compares the value of each group by assigning value to the bars. It is usually used when a variable has many discrete values and is qualitative. 

A line chart is comprised of several lines. It encodes value by the vertical positions of points connected by line segments. This is useful when a baseline is not meaningful, or if the number of bars would be overwhelming to plot.

The pie chart represents the whole with a circle, divided by slices into parts. It is better used in showing the percentage of each part and compare the size of the variables.

In this case, I use a stacked area chart because it is similar to a line chart which could show a clear variation trend from year to year. The colored stacked area below the line make the chart more aesthetically pleasing. I also use row filter in order to show the GDP of every country independently.
